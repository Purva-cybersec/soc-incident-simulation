# üìã SOC Playbook: Suspicious Login + Lateral Movement

## üéØ Purpose
This playbook outlines the standard response procedure for SOC analysts when detecting and investigating suspicious logins, particularly those followed by internal activity such as file access and PowerShell use.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Tools

- Splunk (or other SIEM)
- GeoIP lookup tool (MaxMind, AbuseIPDB)
- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator
- AD/LDAP access for group membership checks
- PowerShell logging enabled (ScriptBlock + Module)

---

## üö® Trigger / Detection Scenarios

| Trigger | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Login from unusual geolocation | e.g., foreign country never associated with user |
| No MFA challenge recorded | Especially if MFA is normally required |
| Sudden SMB/file access to sensitive shares | e.g., HR, Legal, IT |
| PowerShell activity shortly after login | Recon, privilege escalation, C2 |
| Self-added to administrator groups | Detected via audit logs or AD logs |

---

## üß™ Triage Process (Tier 1)

1. **Search for user login events**
   - `index=main sourcetype=auth_logs user="j.smith@company.com"`
2. **Review source IP**
   - Geolocation lookup, check if it‚Äôs new or malicious
3. **Check file access**
   - Look for sensitive files touched in a short time window
4. **PowerShell monitoring**
   - Search for unusual or external communications
5. **Correlate timeline**
   - Determine if actions follow attack patterns

---

## üßØ Response Actions (Tier 2 or Escalated Tier 1)

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Disable user account | Immediately cut access to prevent escalation |
| Block IP address | Block at firewall or proxy |
| Preserve logs | For forensics and root cause analysis |
| Notify IT/security lead | Escalate per IR policy |
| Create incident ticket | Assign severity and link to SOC tracker |

---

## üß† Recommendations & Follow-up

- Enable geo-aware login alerting
- Implement MFA and session validation
- Enable full PowerShell logging
- Use automated alerts for rapid login + internal file access
- Educate staff on credential protection
